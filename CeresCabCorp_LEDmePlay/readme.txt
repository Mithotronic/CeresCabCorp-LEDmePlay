Instructions

It is the year 2200. Port Piazzi is the most important settlement on Ceres which is the largest minor planet in the asteroid belt. However, it is not a place to raise children. Port Piazzi is an overcrowded hotspot for crime and poverty surrounded by space ports, surface mines, smelting and steel works. As if this has not been enough, it is dark, cold, without any atmosphere outside of the habitats, and it has a super low gravity. You are a taxi driver and have to bring your passengers safely to their destinations. Avoid collisions with walls, the surface, gliders, and other dangers. Control thrust into different directions with the joystick (UP or FIRE BUTTON B, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Fly to platforms with waiting passengers and pick them up. The color of the cockpit turns into the color of the destination platform. For orientation press FIRE BUTTON A to see a map of the current sector. If your taxi starts to flash and you hear a warning sound, fly to the nearest gas station to refuel. After you have transported 5 passengers, you are transferred into the next sector. Have a pleasant flight.
